# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: 15 hrs_

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. 

This is a calculator that lives on a server. Because it is accessed indirectly by us. It can store our old calculations

What problem did you solve? We want a way to save old calculations so that we can know which problems we have completeed and dont need to revisit.

How did you solve it?
we save a history of all our calculations on the server. We then request a copy of this history which we can view on our client (our web broswer page)
